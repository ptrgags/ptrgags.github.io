### About This Site

This is my website for showcasing my programming projects throughout the years.
Some of these projects I made back in high school, most have been made
more recently once I learned about Git and GitHub.

My projects are typically unmaintained; They mainly serve as exercises for me
to learn about new topics in computer science or physics.
Most of the time, I try to at least produce a proof-of-concept of each
program/app before moving on to something new to learn.

If anyone would like me to continue development on an unmaintained project,
feel free to let me know.

### About Me

My name is Peter Gagliardi, I am a Computer Science student at Drexel University
and have been programming since 7th grade.

I currently work part-time as a software developer at
[Global Monitoring](http://www.globalmonitoring.com). There I help develop
remote monitoring systems. I have been working there since mid-2014.

My first Drexel co-op in 2015-2016 was at
[Susquehanna International Group](http://www.sig.com).
I was a software developer working on adding features and optimizations
to existing SIG software.

When I'm not busy with school or work, I'm often programming little projects
for fun. My goal is to never stop learning about computer science and other
STEM subjects.
