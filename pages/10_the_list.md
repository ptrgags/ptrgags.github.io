This is a list of possible future projects I'd be interested in trying. I probably won't find time for most of them, but if enough people ask me about a single idea, I might consider making it a project.

Feel free to take inspiration from this list! If you develop something cool, let me know at ptrgags@gmail.com. I'd love to hear about it!
