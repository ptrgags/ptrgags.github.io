## Learning Materials

Here is a list of links I find useful for learning about topics in
computer science, physics and math.

### Computer Science

[*The Nature of Code*](http://natureofcode.com/book/) - eBook that teaches
many concepts from cellular automata to evolutionary computing.

[Unity Tutorials](http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) - Tutorials for
learning about the Unity gaming Engine

[Quicksort](http://me.dt.in.th/page/Quicksort/) - Cool interactive tutorial
about the Quicksort algorithm

### Physics

### Math

[Runge-Kutta](http://www.myphysicslab.com/runge_kutta.html) - Detailed explanation of
the Runge-Kutta approximation algorithm. This is useful for making physics
simulations.

## Programming Environments/Libraries

Here is a list of programming environments/platforms/etc. that I use with varying
frequency.

[SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/) - Programming language designed
for synthesizing music (SuperCollider)

[Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) - Ruby Wrapper for SuperCollider (Ruby)

[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - Arduino Microcontrollers (C++)

[Unity Engine](http://unity3d.com/) - Unity Game Engine (C#)

[Processing](https://processing.org/) - Processing Programming Environment (Java)

[Processing.py](http://py.processing.org/) - Processing extension for Python
(Python)

[p5.js](http://p5js.org/) - Processing extension for the web (JavaScript)

[CreateJS](http://www.createjs.com/) - Useful library for HTML5 development
(JavaScript)
