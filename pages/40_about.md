### About This Site

This is my website for showcasing my programming projects throughout the years.
few of these projects I made back in high school, but most projects are from
my college years and beyond.

My repositories are typically unmaintained; They serve as exercises for me
to learn new topics in computer science/physics/math. Most of the time, I try
to make a proof of concept before moving on to new topics.

If anyone would like me to continue development on an unmaintained project,
please let me know.
