# ptrgags.dev (2016-2020, 2024)

This is the third iteration of my GitHub website. The first two used Jekyll,
but this time I wanted to build it from scratch using Vue.js.

This iteration of my website aims to be a portfolio of my creative works.
Of course this includes programming, but I want to showcase other art and
music I do over time
