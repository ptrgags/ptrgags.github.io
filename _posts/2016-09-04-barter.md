title: "Barter, Revisited"
brief: >
    Now that I'm back from a busy school year, I'm revisiting an old project
    to try what I learned about graph theory.

I'm back from a long busy summer quarter at Drexel. It was a productive
quarter, I learned a lot about systems programming and data structures.
Now I'm trying to use that knowledge to good use. I'm revisiting Barter, a
project from two years ago. I changed the data structures used to be a proper
adjacency list for a directed graph. What I had before was close, but harder
to maintain.

I also refactored the JavaScript code to make use of features of ECMAScript 6
including classes and `Promise`s.

### New Design Methodology

I'm also trying to manage my personal programming projects better. My thought
is that I have not been clearly defining goals for myself, so I would get
overwhelmed with the plethora of projects and features I want to work on.
This time around, I am clearly defining smaller chunks of work for myself and
then focusing on only one at a time.

Next on my agenda: Make a simple command-line program for writing stories for
Barter. This is because JSON is tedious to write by hand.

### Change List:

* Update the Barter page
