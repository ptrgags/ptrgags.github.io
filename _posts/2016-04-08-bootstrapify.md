Since last evening I've been working on changing my site theme to be a custom
Bootstrap theme to be consistent with my older theme.

So far, it's looking good. I'm using a mix of the Jekyll SCSS and Bootstrap
so I can have both code highlighting and bootstrap classes.

### Change List:

* Change site templates to use Bootstrap
* Add table SCSS code for markdown tables.
