### Barter Update

I released version 0.2 of Barter recently! It includes Barter Story Creator,
a Ruby Script for writing stories for Barter.

I also wrote a short Barter story with my friend and added that to the project
too.

### Timekeeper

To prepare for my co-op, I made a quick web app to try out AngularJS and
MomentJS. It's a page for converting timestamps from one timezone to another.

It was a one-day project, but I hope it's useful to me and others over time.

### Change List:

* Update the Barter page
* Add the Timekeeper page
