I didn't like my old GitHub Pages site, so I decided to try Jekyll.
At the very least, it will save me some time in constructing the site.

The first step is getting rid of the pre-generated Jekyll content and replacing
it with my own content.

I eventually plan on changing this site to use a
dark theme as well as loading some content from other hosting. For now,
I will focus on learning the basics of Jekyll.
