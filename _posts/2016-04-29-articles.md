title: "Update: Adding articles"
brief: >
    Now that my site layout is mostly complete, I can start writing articles
    about my projects.
categories: posts

Today I am adding articles for each of my projects. There are a lot of them,
so I am mainly focusing on getting the layout and basic information about
each one written up. Eventually, I will return to fill in text that I skipped
for each project.

Each project page is designed to describe the project and list some details
about what languages and libraries I use. I also list what parts of the
project I am proud of and what parts I think could have been done better.

In the future, I might move some of the conceptual ideas into separate
tutorial articles so my project pages can be smaller.

### Change List:

* Make a grid layout in the Projects Page
* Add articles for all of my projects.
