Today I'm adding MathJax support to this site. I will need it for explaining
some of my physics/math demos.

Let's test it out:

**Display Style**:

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

**Inline Style**: \\(a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\\)

Works like a charm!

I also added a few more formatting changes as I work on my Physics Simulations
project page.

### Change List:

* Added MathJax
* Minor formatting changes (Changed Heading 2 -> Heading 3 in many articles)
* Added include for easily inserting YouTube videos.
* Added a Featured Projects column on the home page.
