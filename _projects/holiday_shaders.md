description: My first pixel shaders
purpose: >
    Recently I learned about how to make pixel shaders. For the holidays,
    I made a shader gallery for my friends.
status: demo
repo: holiday_shaders
languages:
    - JavaScript
    - Three.js
    - GLSL
concepts:
    - Fragment (Pixel) Shaders
    - Rendering 2D graphics in 3D
    - Polar coordinates
    - Voronoi Diagrams
    - Lens Distortion
    - Iterated Function System Fractals
accomplishments:
    - Set up an environment from scratch for displaying pixel shaders.
    - Wrote 12 pixel shaders covering many concepts.
improvements:
    - Nothing for this project. New shaders will go elsewhere

### Pixel Shaders

Pixel shaders are a type of program that runs on the GPU rather than the CPU.
These programs are used to calculate colors to display in 3D and 2D games. In
my case, I have only written 2D shaders so far.
