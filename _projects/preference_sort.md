description: Sort a list by preference by making simple choices
purpose: >
    I find it difficult to pick favorites out of a long list of items. However,
    it is easier to pick between two elements at a time. I decided to make a
    silly sorting algorithm that takes a list of strings and asks the user
    to compare pairs of elements until a winner emerges.
