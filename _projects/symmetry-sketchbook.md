### Inspiration

I've been reading _Creative Symmetry: The Artful Mathematics of Wallpaper Patterns_ by Frank A. Farris. It's a pretty fascinating read. Its main goal is to generate patterns with wallpaper symmetry using functions of complex numbers. However, several other neat concepts are discussed along the way, from rosette curves, and patterns with point and frieze symmetry.

This project is my explorations of the math presented by this book.
