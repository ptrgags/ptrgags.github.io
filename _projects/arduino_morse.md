description: Arduino Morse Code Signaler
purpose: >
    A CodeWars problem about binary morse code gave me the idea for
    trying to make an Arduino project that converts an ASCII message
    to binary morse code and then flash it on LEDs.
status: demo
repo: arduino-morse
languages:
    - Python
    - C++ (Arduino)
concepts:
    - Binary Morse Code
    - Serial communication
    - ASCII and other encodings
accomplishments:
    - Working Arduino signaling device
    - Python script that converts text to binary morse code
    - Arduino device
improvements:
    - Refactor the Python code
    - Allow for signaling with ASCII bytes
    - More robust serial protocol
