description: Animations driven by text hashes.
purpose: >
    Hashes have many uses from security to quick lookups in a hash table.
    However, I noticed that MD5 hashes and SHA-1 hashes generate hexadecimal
    numbers as the output string. I decided to use these hex numbers as a
    seed for otherwise random animations.
