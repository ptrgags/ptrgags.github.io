description: Playing Cards that fit in a byte
purpose: >
    Karishma and I wanted to make digital playing cards. We noticed that it only
    takes 52 possible integers to make a regular deck of playing cards, but a
    byte can be one of 256 possible unsigned integers. We decided to change the
    number of ranks from 13 to 16 to make our new cards that easily fit in a
    byte.
