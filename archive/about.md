Hello there, I'm Peter Gagliardi, a programmer, artist, and STEM enthusiast. I have many interests and where I can, I try to turn them into art. In particular, I focus on geometric abstract art. My art tools are an interesting motley from fountain pens to programming languages.

Professionally, I am a [3D graphics software developer](https://cesium.com/team/PeterGagliardi/) at [Cesium](https://cesium.com). There, I do various 3D and UI development, mostly related to the [Smart Construction digital twin](https://cesium.com/blog/2020/03/10/smart-construction/) we're building for Komatsu Ltd. In the relatively short time I've worked here, I've learned many things about computer graphics, geospatial data (especially concerning datums and map projections), Cesium's [3D Tiles](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles) format, and even a little bit about civil engineering. I've also met a lot of great people at work, all passionate about what they do.

I've also recently become a [member of ACM SIGGRAPH](https://www.siggraph.org/member-profile/peter-gagliardi/).

I do have a [ShaderToy account](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/ptrgags) but I mostly use it for experimenting with shaders. The final results end up in my GitHub repos
