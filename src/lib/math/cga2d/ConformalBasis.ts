/**
 * This class has some static fuctions for switching
 * between the (p, m) and (inf, o) bases in CGA.
 * These are essentially matrix transforms, written as functions
 *
 * For the (inf, 0) -> (p, m) direction, we need a matrix A such that
 * A(inf) = (1, 1) (by definition of inf)
 * A(o) = (-1/2, 1/2) (by definition of o)
 *
 * Since inf is [1, 0] and o is [0, 1] in this basis, the matrix is simply
 * listing these values as columns:
 * A = [1 -1/2]
 *     [1  1/2]
 *
 * For the other direction, it's a matrix inverse. I'll save you the algebra,
 * it's
 *
 * A^(-1) = [1/2 1/2]
 *          [-1   1 ]
