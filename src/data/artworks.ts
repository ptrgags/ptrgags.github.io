            A scarf knitted with blue and black velvet yarn. From start to
            finish, it took me about a month and a half, faster than the previous
            scarf I made.

            This crochet pattern was inspired by the TED talk <a href="https://youtu.be/w1TBZhd-sN0?si=XsH01B6DCeU8LoqT">"Crocheting Hyperbolic Planes"</a>
            by Daina Taimi≈Üa. Every stitch is an increase.

        <p>
            Since each additional row is twice the length of the previous one,
            there is no way for the fabric to lay flat. Instead, it curls
            up in 3D space.
        </p>
        <p>
            This type of growth happens often in nature. For example, think
            of brains, coral, or lettuce.
