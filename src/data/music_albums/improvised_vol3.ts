            I keep a digital recorder near my synth keyboards so I can record
            my synth jams. I wait until I fill up the SD card and then
            edit them in bulk. These improvisations were recorded this spring, 
            but edited much later.

            The first half of the album is a collection of miscellaneous
            synthesizer tracks. The second half is a number of electric piano
            tracks. I used my Yamaha Reface CP which emulates classic EPs like
            Rhodes and Wurlitzers.
