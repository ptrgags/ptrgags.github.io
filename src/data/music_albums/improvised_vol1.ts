      This album was released alongside <a href="#/album/improvised-vol2">Improvised Volume 2</a>
      on Halloween 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lockdown years, making music was a big hobby. I fell pretty far down the 
      rabbit hole of buying hardware synthesizers and other music equipment.
      I wanted to get away from my computer, so I got a digital recorder and
      just recorded me improvising on keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      This first volume is a collection of the better improvisations I had
      recorded in the first half of 2021.

        My Roland System-1 is named "Vincent" because I once referred to the
        synth as "Green Synth" too fast in a call with a friend. My mumbling
        probably sounded like "grinsinth". My friend misheard this as
        "Vincent" and so that synth has been named that ever since.

          [EDIT 2024: Wow, looking back at these liner notes from 2021 and the
          moody tracks of this album, I see how much the pandemic and lockdown
          was affecting my mental health at the time ðŸ˜¢. In comparison, 
          my 2024 album <a href="#/album/loops">Loops</a> is a lot brighter
          and lively overall.]
