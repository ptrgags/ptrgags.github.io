            My latest experiment with music mixes old and modern tech.
            I got a small cassette recorder to try making a low-fi album.
            Magnetic tape has unique sonic qualities that I wanted to capture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the course of about a month and a half, I recorded synth
            jams to a cassette tape. Once filled, I digitized the tape
            and edited it down to the best improvisations.
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried to keep my edits minimal to retain the low-fi vibe. I
            mostly normalized the volume level. However, there were a few
            places where noise reduction was helpful in making sure the
            melody is audible.
