    It's been about two and a half years since I last made music (see
    <a href="#/album/improvised-vol2">Improvised Volume 2</a>).
    I wanted to get more comfortable writing music in
    a digital audio workstation (DAW), so I tried my hand at making background
    music loops. I used more synth presets so I could focus on composition.
  </p>
  <p>
    One big inspiration for this album was the soundtrack from the game 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sun">Golden Sun</a> for 
    Gameboy Advance. It was my favorite RPG as a kid. I studied
    the soundtrack and re-watched <a href="https://youtu.be/9yxEPZ1vCnM?si=KxZP08nysqhKlruk">8-bit Music Theory's video</a>
    about the game's music. I learned quite a few things about the structure
    of background music (often a simple AB loop is enough!), the choice
    of instruments (e.g. mallet percussion + delay makes nice ethereal vibes),
    and use of unusual time signatures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KeygenGirl">@KeygenGirl</a> 
    for our discussions about music production, that helped me get enthusiastic
    about making music again. And she provided some tips about mixing that
    came in handy!

        This was the first track I made for this album. I call it a "structure 
        parody" of the <a href="https://youtu.be/N9hfd28ezfQ?si=bE-T7egB3HkQnKZO">Jupiter Lighthouse theme</a>
        from Golden Sun: The Lost Age. I mimicked the following details of the
        track:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structure - The track is a short AB loop.</li>
          <li>
            Contours - The mallet percussion arpeggiates upwards except for the 
            last chord of each section where it arpeggiates downwards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Instruments - I tried to find similar-sounding synths.
          </li>
          <li>
            Effects - Several of the instruments have a delay (echo) effect
            which helps give an ethereal sound. Only later did I realize that
            I used a longer delay that's not quite the same as the slapback
            delay of the original.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, everything else was written from scratch:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Chords - I made up a new chord progression.</li>
          <li>
            Melodies - All the melodies and arpeggios were written based
            on the new chord progression.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rhythm - For the flute chord, I repeated the stacatto chord
            a few times to give it more motion than in the original.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where the original has a mysterious, ethereal vibe, my experiment
          had a brighter, wintertime vibe. I think this has to do with the
          change in chord progression and the metallic percussion.
