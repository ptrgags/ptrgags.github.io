            This shader combined my typical geometric art style with
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagrams</a>.
            To make this shader, I created a collection of pattern fills that
            are directly inspired by patterns I draw on paper. These patterns
            are reused in a few different shaders in this collection.

            This shader was a happy accident. I had originally intended to make
            a snowflake shape. However, halfway through, I had an image
            that looked like this. It made me think of spider webs, or the
            cross-section of a nautilus shell. This is why the shader was
            titled "Shell".

            A common theme in many of these shaders is working in polar coordinates.
            This is one of the more intricate examples. Here I'm using the
            same collection of patterns from  <a href="#/artwork/holiday-shaders2/2024-11-21_Toast">Voronoi Doodle</a>
            and a few other shaders in Holiday Shaders 2. In this case, the
            patterns are bent into curved regions.

            This shader was the result of trying out a tutorial on fractal 
            Brownian motion from <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/13/">The 
            Book of Shaders</a>. Somehow (more by accident than intention), I
            found settings that looked like liquid metal.

            In Holiday Shaders 2 I made a few different variations on the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_fractal">Newton Fractal</a>
            technique. This "mosaic" style is by far my favorite one, as the
            shading feels most polished.
