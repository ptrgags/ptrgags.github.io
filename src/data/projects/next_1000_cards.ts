    <p>An ongoing project to draw 1000 trading card sized doodles.</p>
    <p>
        In recent months, I've revisited doodling with fountain pen on paper.
        Back around college I was doing that a lot, see for example my
        <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/ptrgags/gallery">DeviantArt gallery</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the key things that kept me drawing often was my art trading
        card binder. I would make trading-card sized artworks (2.5x3.5 inches)
        and store them in a binder with trading card sleeves. It was exciting
        to see the binder fill up over time. Somewhere around 2021 or 2022
        I reached the big milestone of drawing 1000 cards for my binder! 
    </p>
    <p>
        After that, I put drawing on the shelf for a long while. But recently,
        when I found myself using fountain pens again for journaling, I decided
        to doodle again, more passively this time. Most days, I start a
        journaling session by making a doodle.
    </p>
    <p>
        To give myself something to aim for, I plan to fill a new binder with 
        1000 cards again, even if that takes years. I'm not posting every 
        single card. That would be far too tedious to edit, and some cards
        turn out nicer than others. Instead, I'm occasionally posting my
        favorites.
