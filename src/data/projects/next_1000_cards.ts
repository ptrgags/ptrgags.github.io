    <p>A long-term project to draw 1000 more trading-card sized doodles.</p>
    <p>
        In recent months, I've revisited doodling with fountain pen on paper.
        During college, I was drawing often. See for example my 
        <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/ptrgags/gallery">DeviantArt gallery</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the key things that kept me drawing often was my art trading
        card binder. I would make trading-card sized artworks (2.5x3.5 inches)
        and store them in a binder with trading card sleeves. It was exciting
        to see the binder fill up over time. Somewhere in the lockdown years I
        reached the big milestone of drawing 1000 cards for my binder!
    </p>
    <p>
        After that, I put drawing on the shelf for a long while. However,
        a couple months ago I found myself using fountain pens again for
        journaling. I decied to doodle again, but more passively this time.
        I start most journaling sessions by making a doodle.
    </p>
    <p>
        A doodle a day quickly adds up to a large collection. It would
        be tedious to post every single card, and the quality of cards varies
        from day to day. Instead, I'll periodically post batches of my
        favorites.

            While documenting this first batch of cards, I realized that I drew
            a lot of cards in october! On 10-01 I drew card #11. On 10-31 I drew
            card #42. That's 32 cards in total, a hair over 1 card per day!

            In the past years, I've done the <a href="https://inktober.com/">Inktober drawing challenge</a>.
            See my sketches from 
            <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/ptrgags/gallery/64663431/inktober-2017">2017</a> 
            and 
            <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/ptrgags/gallery/67366134/inktober-2018">2018</a> 
            for example.
            I find it amusing that I did the equivalent of an Inktober without
            intending to this year!
