        <p>Generative art for thermal printers</p>
        <p>
            A long time ago I saw someone on Twitter make generative art on
            a receipt printer. I sadly didn't bookmark the post, but the
            concept stuck with me. Eventually I decided to get myself a
            receipt printer of myself and make my own art.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is written in Python. It generates PostScript code
            representing a document that draws the art. I then use GhostScript
            to convert this to PDF since that's easier to print from.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why PostScript? Even though it's old, I like it for its simplicity.
            It's a stack-based language for drawing documents, so commands like
            drawing paths, rectangles, etc are all built-in. To learn more, see
            the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/jp/print/postscript/pdfs/PLRM.pdf">PostScript Language Reference Manual</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            One goal for this project was to make a simple sketchbook-like
            format, inspired by <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>.
            I've always liked that Processing makes it very easy to start
            drawing on the screen. I realized that adopting such a goal in
            projects like this one would make it easier for me to create more
            art. For this project, that felt successful. I managed to make
            many artworks, and it's very easy to add more over time if I so
            choose.

            This is the second scarf I've ever knit. This one used velvet
            yarn in two colors to make it extra soft. The blue yarn is
            a tiny bit thicker, which gives the scarf extra thickness.
        </p>
        <p>
            I kept the pattern simple so I could knit while watching a show
            or spending time with friends. The pattern is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Row 0: Cast on 32 stitches in blue.</li>
            <li>Rows 1-10: Stockinette stitch. Start with blue and switch color every 5 stitches</li>
            <li>Rows 11-12: Stockinette stitch in blue only</li>
            <li>Repeat rows 1-12 until you reach the desired length. I did 25 repeats total</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The interesting zig-zag pattern happens for two reasons. First, 
            switching colors every 5 stitches (which does not divide evenly into the
            32 columns), this produces a stripe pattern. However, since knitting
            flat involves going back and forth, every other row is flipped
            horizontally.

            I originally read <cite>Creating Symmetry</cite> in 2019, and wanted
            to try out some of the techniques described in the book. I made a
            sketchbook of p5.js sketches to experiment.

        <p>
            By the time I got to rosette patterns, I realized that using a
            WebGL shader would be the best way to implement the patterns. This
            is because the patterns require calculations at every pixel.
            Since each calculation is independent, this works nicely.
        </p>
        <p>
            One downside with the old version was the UI had gotten clunky. I
            tried to do too many things on one page, and that made it hard to

            When I went to clean up Symmetry Sketchbook to feature on this
            portfolio website, I felt disatisfied with the old UI. After
            thinking about it for a while, I had some ideas for a better
            way to present this project. My new design goals included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Instead of one big page that does too much, split into several
                smaller sections based on the type of pattern (curve, rosette,
                frieze, wallpaper) to make the UI look less busy.
            </li>
            <li>
                In each section, make a gallery with a simple interface for
                a general audience, but then have a more advanced interface for
                me to design patterns.
            </li>
            <li>
                I had some ideas to make the editor more visual. I never enjoyed
                typing in numbers for the coefficients.
            </li>
            <li>
                I wanted to change how I did the color palettes. When using
                the old version I found that simple solid color palettes work
                better than complex images, so I wanted to lean into this
                more.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the UI, I figured <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>
                would be helpful. Before I was using custom Web Components.
                That was a good learning experience, but too tedious.
            </li>
            <li>
                Given the complexity of the code and math in this project,
                I decided to switch to TypeScript for my sanity.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            This crocheting project was inspired by the TED talk <a href="https://youtu.be/w1TBZhd-sN0?si=XsH01B6DCeU8LoqT">"Crocheting Hyperbolic Planes"</a>
            by Daina TaimiÅ†a. Hyperbolic crocheting is pretty simple, you just
            keep doing increases and the fabric will naturally curl up into
            organic-looking patterns. The video mentions using a slow growth
            rate such as 11/10. However, I used a much faster growth rate of
            2.
        </p>
        <p>
            I kept my pattern very simple, essentially the same stitch over
            and over. It was nice as a way to keep my hands busy when watching
            or listening to something.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Row 0: Chain 10</li>
            <li>Row 1, 2, ..., N-2: inc in every stitch</li>
            <li>Row N-2: dc in every stitch.</li>
            <li>Row N-1: sc in  different color</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I worked on this project off and on over the span of a little over
            2 years. Some months I would work on it often, other times I
            wouldn't work on it at all.
