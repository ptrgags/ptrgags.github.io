        <p>Generative art for thermal printers</p>
        <p>
            A long time ago I saw someone on Twitter make generative art on
            a receipt printer. I sadly didn't bookmark the post, but the
            concept stuck with me. Eventually I decided to get myself a
            receipt printer of myself and make my own art.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is written in Python. It generates PostScript code
            representing a document that draws the art. I then use GhostScript
            to convert this to PDF since that's easier to print from.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why PostScript? Even though it's old, I like it for its simplicity.
            It's a stack-based language for drawing documents, so commands like
            drawing paths, rectangles, etc are all built-in. To learn more, see
            the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/jp/print/postscript/pdfs/PLRM.pdf">PostScript Language Reference Manual</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            One goal for this project was to make a simple sketchbook-like
            format, inspired by <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>.
            I've always liked that Processing makes it very easy to start
            drawing on the screen. I realized that adopting such a goal in
            projects like this one would make it easier for me to create more
            art. For this project, that felt successful. I managed to make
            many artworks, and it's very easy to add more over time if I so
            choose.

            A tool for the indecisive. This web app lets you make a list of ideas
            and rank them using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo rating system</a> like in chess.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've always found it unusually difficult to pick favorites from a long list. So I decided to make myself
            a tool for myself to make it easier. I saw some videos about the math of the Elo rating system, and
            realized it would be a good fit. See the GitHub project for more details.

            This project was a warm-up exercise to learn about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API">WebGPU</a>.
            I made an animation of cubes that stretch and shrink. See the Demo
            link above for the animated version.
        </p>
        <p>
            The animation is done completely procedurally in the shader. I make use of
            GPU instancing so I only have to upload a single cube to the GPU. All the
            shapes, colors, animations and so on are done mathematically in the shader.
