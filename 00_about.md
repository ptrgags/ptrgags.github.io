This is my website for showcasing my programming projects throughout the years.
Some of these projects I made back in high school, most have been made
more recently once I learned about Git and GitHub.

My projects are typically unmaintained; They mainly serve as exercises for me
to learn about new topics in computer science or physics.
Most of the time, I try to at least produce a proof-of-concept of each
program/app before moving on to something new to learn.

If anyone would like me to continue development on an unmaintained project,
feel free to let me know.
